		<p>
  		My first experience with coding was back in 1977 when our high school received a teletype terminal which was connected to the local college mainframe.  We stored our BASIC program on paper tape.  In college, I learned Fortran on a card punch batch processing system and COBOL which had to be compiled before it could be run.  These earlier programming languages were quite different than today’s object oriented languages such a Java and C+.  Now it is on to the languages of the NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP along with the vast libraries of code sprung from them.
